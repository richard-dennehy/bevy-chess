 - Add orbit camera (see https://github.com/bonsairobo/smooth-bevy-cameras)
 - Fancier piece movement (easing, y movement)
 - Experiment with using `#[path]` to better map test modules to files
 - Break up the test suite into something sane
 - Split bevy systems from generic logic
 - Create a proper texture for the chessboard (blender nodes material doesn't appear to import/export properly)
