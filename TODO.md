 - Add orbit camera (see https://github.com/bonsairobo/smooth-bevy-cameras)
 - Fix general piece placement
 - Fix black piece placement (adjustments appear to be backwards because of rotation)
 - Fancier piece movement (easing, y movement)
 - Check stalemate (no valid moves i.e. King not in check, but can't move)
 - Use UV for 2d coordinates instead of XY (or maybe use rank/file)
 - Experiment with using `#[path]` to better map test modules to files
 - Break up the test suite into something sane
 - Reduce the size of the square highlights
 - Split bevy systems from generic logic
